## The goal of this project

The goal of this project is to get a weird retro operating system interpreting programs written in a functional programming language to run on a rig with my spare Am486 DX4-120.

The goal of this project is **NOT** to get this funky operating system to run on any random hardware, specifically my hardware that I decided. :)
